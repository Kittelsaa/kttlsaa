description: The goal is Tech Literacy for Everyone

I've always found it natural to share what I know about the tech world and its incredible potential to transform lives. Whether it's understanding what algorithms and AI really is, or demystifying tech lingo that once felt like a foreign language.

But as I spent more time in conversations with people from all walks of life, I noticed a troubling pattern. So many brilliant minds around me are completely intimidated by technology, feeling like outsiders looking into a world that seemed designed only for engineers and programmers. It's always comments like "I'm not technical enough for this" or "AI sounds scary; I don't understand it." 

Here's the thing that struck me: **we're already living in the tech world**. Every time someone uses a smartphone, engages with social media, or relies on digital banking, they're not just consuming technology; they're participating in a digital ecosystem. The problem isn't that we need more technical programmers; it's that collectively we need to become fluent in the digital world.

I saw an opportunity to build a platform that bridges this gap: **[TechBaseRw](https://techbaserw.kttlsaa.com/)** is a space where digital literacy is about understanding the tools that shape our daily lives. Where a elderly person can learn what algorithms mean for her Facebook feed, where a small business owner can grasp how AI might help their venture, where students can see technology not as magic, but as tools they can leverage and even influence.

The vision became clear: if people understand their digital environment, they become active participants rather than passive consumers. And when that happens across entire communities, you don't just change individual lives; you build a foundation for Rwanda's tech future from the ground up.

Bi-directional links are connections that work both ways, creating a web of interconnected thoughts. When you link to a note, that note knows it's been linked to.

## Historical Context

The concept dates back to Vannevar Bush's Memex machine in 1945, but has gained renewed interest with tools like Roam Research and modern [Digital Gardens](/notes/digital-gardens).

## Benefits

1. Discover unexpected connections
2. Create context-rich knowledge networks
3. Support [Non-Linear Learning](/notes/non-linear-learning)

## Implementation in Digital Gardens

In my garden, bi-directional links help create an emergent structure where ideas naturally cluster and relate to each other.

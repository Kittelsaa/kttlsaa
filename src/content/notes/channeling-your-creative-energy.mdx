Paul Graham's essay ["How to Do Great Work"](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) offers a collection of ideas that have helped me and many others know exactly where to direct their [creative energy](/notes/start-building-things).

This illustration by @jasonshen outlines the essay into a visual guide that reveals something crucial: great work emerges from the intersection of deep curiosity, 
natural aptitude and the courage to work on projects you genuinely care about. This framework helps you ask the right question: "Am I working on what I most want to work on?"
Most creative suffering comes not from a lack of talent, but from avoiding the work that you're meant to do.
I recommend keeping this illustration open while reading the essay here. It would actually be better if you created your own visual summary as you read.

I'll be honest, this is trickier to follow now more than it's ever been. The modern internet has provided endless content, dopamine hits that come every few seconds. 
These algorithms want to keep us scrolling instead of creating. I notice this struggle in myself and I see it in almost everyone around me, that urge to let our creative 
energy dissipate into endless feeds of other people's work instead of doing our own.
But here's the thing, just recognizing that your mind has been hijacked is powerful. I'm optimistic that once we acknowledge this addiction we can experiment
& build better habits. Our creative force doesn't disappear, it just gets redirected into passive consumption. The challenge is catching yourself in the moment and
redirecting your energy toward something you want to build instead.
I don't have this figured out, but what helps me is forcibly disconnecting from my socials and the lack of notification alarms. I also usually use summaries to understand 
the context/overview before I go though a whole talk, lecture, essay, book, etc... 
Paul Graham writes about needing to "get to the frontiers" of your field. But you can't reach frontiers if you never let your mind wander. Boredom is where our 
ideas germinate. We should be able to handle 15 minutes of pure boredom without reaching for a device.

But honestly? I'm still experimenting. If you've found frameworks or principles that actually work for protecting your creative energy, please share them with me. 
I believe the people who figure out how to create consistently despite the attention economy will do the most interesting work of our generation.

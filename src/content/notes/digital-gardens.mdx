Digital gardens are personal knowledge spaces that embrace [Bi-Directional Links](/notes/bi-directional-links) to create a web of interconnected thoughts and ideas. Unlike traditional blogs, they follow a [Non-Linear Learning](/notes/non-linear-learning) approach where notes can evolve over time.

## Key Features of Digital Gardens

1. Living documents that evolve
2. Interconnected ideas through bi-directional links
3. Various stages of completion (seedling → budding → evergreen)
4. Focus on learning in public

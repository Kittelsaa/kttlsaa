Obsidian has proven to be a powerful tool for me when it comes to taking notes, this is different 
for different people, there are many other **[apps](https://taking-notes-six.vercel.app/posts/notes-taking-tool)** 
and systems to use to take effective notes. 

Considering that I've tried nearly every note-taking app out there, here are different reasons why Obsidian 
works for me as a Software Engineer:
- Obsidian is freeware and not open source so my data is open and stored as plain text markdown. 
I'm not sure if obsidian may eventually go away but my data is stored on my computer in plain text. Will Dropbox, 
Google Drive, and iCloud all exist in 10 years I'm not sure but I still have the data in plain text so I can edit 
and read it with any text editor.
- Obsidian is offline first means that the data is stored on your computer or phone
- The app currently has 2,527 plugins in the built-in plugin installer and you may easily create your own, 
plugins are written in JavaScript and can change any part of the system 
- It's fast and reliable compared to Notion, Google Notes, etc.
- Obsidian has a customizable interface, you can customize the app to your preferences. I don't do this 
regularly because it can be waste of time when you focus too hard on customizing that you forget to take notes.
